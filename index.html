                        <h3>Customer Service</h3>
                        <p>After receiving a bachelor's degree in advertising, I moved to Atlanta to go to portfolio school to become a graphic designer and copywriter. Didn't work out. I started working in B2B healthcare customer service, which instead, gave me a ton of experience working one-on-one with customers and to understand the problems they faced.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Content Development</h3>
                        <p>Although I loved speaking directly with customers, I knew I wanted to do creative work. I asked for more tasks outside my duties and landed a role as an Ecommerce Content Specialist. I helped develop an online product database of 200,000 products. I developed content for products and at the same time, built a B2C online product database. On this website, I helped design the navigation and did SEO.</p>

                            <h3>Front-End Web Development</h3>
                            <p>After spending so much time with websites, communicating with developers, and doing user acceptance testing, I became curious about development. I completed a 10-week Front-End Web Development course through General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built my first website from scratch, but still felt something was missing. I liked FEWD, but didn't want to become a developer.</p>
